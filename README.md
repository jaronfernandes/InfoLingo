# InfoLingo
Csc207 project InfoLingo ðŸ“° ðŸ“° ðŸ“°

A readme.md file which must include:
## a description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting to focus on in the project. (e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etcâ€¦) []


##  a brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team is thinking of developing.
###  This is mostly just so we can give you some initial feedback on whether your team might want to reconsider your project direction. []

Our team is thinking of focusing on a centralised news app. It will organise news from a variety of sources into one 
location. It will also provide a translation tool, so you can get you're news from even more sources, despite language
barriers. We also want to provide auto-generated summaries of articles, so you don't have to read each article in their 
entirety.


## a link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to the domain. []
https://currentsapi.services/en 

https://libretranslate.com/


## a screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like https://www.postman.com/Links to an external site. or https://hoppscotch.io/Links to an external site.Links to an external site.) []

## example output of running your Java code (see below). []

## a list of any technical problems blocking progress (if any) []

## please don't hesitate to ask such questions on Piazza too of course. []
